School project developed as part of the 'Database Interface Programming' course under the guidance of Mr. Valentin Pupezescu.

The project was implemented in Eclipse using the Java Hibernate framework (an open-source object-relational mapping tool) and aimed at managing an existing database created in MySQL Workbench.

The application is designed to run on the Apache Tomcat server, providing database editing functionalities such as deletion, addition, and modification.
